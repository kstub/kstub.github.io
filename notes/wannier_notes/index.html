<h4 id="notational-setup">Notational Setup</h4>
<ul>
<li>\(\Lambda\) is the lattice spanned with Bravais lattice vectors \(\bm{v}_1, \bm{v}_2\):
\[\Lambda = \{ n_1 \bm{v}_1 + n_2 \bm{v}_2 : n_1, n_2 \in \Z^2 \}\]</li>
<li>\(\Lambda^*\) is the dual lattice to \(\Lambda\) spanned by \(\bm{w}_1, \bm{w}_2\) satisfying \(\bm{v}_i \cdot \bm{w}_j = 2 \pi \delta_{ij}\)
\[
\Lambda^* = \{ n_1 \bm{w}_1 + n_2 \bm{w}_2 : n_1, n_2 \in \Z^2 \}
\]</li>
<li>\(\Omega = \R^2 / \Lambda\) is a fundamental cell.</li>
<li>\(\Omega^* = \R^2 / \Lambda^*\) is the Brillioun zone.</li>
<li>\(T_{\bm{v}_i}\) translation by the lattice vector \(\bm{v}_i\), that is for any \(f\)
\[
T_{\bm{v}_i} f(\bm{x}) := f(\bm{x} + \bm{v}_i).
\]
Notice that the collection \(\{ T_{\bm{v}} \}_{\bm{v} \in \Lambda}\) forms an abelian group.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="periodic-hamiltonians-and-bloch-functions">Periodic Hamiltonians and Bloch Functions</h4>
<p>Suppose we are given a Hamiltonian \(H\) which commutes with group of translations \(\{ T_{\bm{v}} \}_{\bm{v} \in \Lambda}\). That is \([ H, T_{\bm{v}} ] = 0\) for all \(\bm{v} \in \Lambda\). The <strong>Bloch functions</strong> are defined as a simultaneous eigenbasis of \(H\) and \(\{ T_{\bm{v}} \}_{\bm{v} \in \Lambda}\).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose that \(\psi\) is one such simultaneous eigenfunction:
\[\begin{aligned}
&amp; H \psi(\bm{x}) = \lambda \psi(\bm{x}) \\[.5ex]
&amp; T_{\bm{v}} \psi(\bm{x}) = e^{i \theta_{\bm{v}}} \psi(\bm{x})
\end{aligned}\]
where the \(\lambda \in \R\) and \(\theta_{\bm{v}} \in \R\)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Of course, since \(\{ T_{\bm{v}} \}_{\bm{v} \in \Lambda}\) form a group, the values \(\theta_{\bm{v}}\) also have to satisfy some additional symmetry. In particular, consider the following calculation
\[\begin{aligned}
e^{i \theta_{\bm{v} + \bm{w}}} \psi(\bm{x})
= T_{\bm{v} + \bm{w}} \psi(\bm{x})
= T_{\bm{v}} T_{\bm{w}} \psi(\bm{x})
= e^{i \theta_{\bm{v}}} e^{i \theta_{\bm{w}}} \psi(\bm{x})
\end{aligned}\]
Defining the function \(\theta : \Lambda \rightarrow \R\) by \(\bm{v} \mapsto \theta_{\bm{v}}\), the above calculation implies that \(\theta\) is a linear functional. Therefore, by the Riesz representation theorem, we can represent all possible choices of \(\theta_{\bm{v}}\) as follows:
\[
\theta_{\bm{v}} = \bm{k} \cdot \bm{v} \quad \text{where} \quad \bm{k} \in \R.
\]
Notice, for any \(w \in \Lambda^*\) we have
\[
e^{i (\bm{k} + \bm{w}) \cdot \bm{v}} = e^{i \bm{k} \cdot \bm{v}} e^{i \bm{w} \cdot \bm{v}} = e^{i \bm{k} \cdot \bm{v}}
\]
therefore it suffices to consider \(\bm{k}\) in the Brillouin zone of \(\Lambda\) (i.e. \(\bm{k} \in \Omega^*\)).</p>
<p>With this observation, finding a simulataneous eigenbasis of \(H\) and translation reduces to the following family of PDE problems (one for each \(\bm{k} \in \Omega^*\)):
\[\begin{aligned}
&amp; H \psi(\bm{x}) = \lambda \psi(\bm{x}) \\[.5ex]
&amp; \psi(\bm{x} + \bm{v}) = e^{i \bm{k} \cdot \bm{v}} \psi(\bm{x})
\end{aligned}\]
For our last technical definition, for each \(\bm{k} \in \Omega^*\) define the space \(L^2_{\bm{k}}(\Omega)\) as follows:
\[
L^2_{\bm{k}}(\Omega) := \{ f : f \in L^2(\Omega) \text{ and } f(\bm{x} + \bm{v}_i) = e^{i \bm{k} \cdot \bm{v}_i} f(\bm{x}) \}
\]
Since the domain \(\Omega\) is compact, if \(H\) satisifies some mild technical conditions, it can be shown that the operator \(H\) has a countable, orthogonal basis of eigenfunctions \(\phi_{n,\bm{k}} \in L^2_{\bm{k}}(\Omega)\) where \(n \in \N\). Furthermore, the collection \(\{ \phi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) : n \in \N, \bm{k} \in \Omega^* \}\) is complete in \(L^2(\R^2)\). This collection of functions are known as the <strong>Bloch functions</strong> for \(H\).</p>
<h4 id="the-problem-of-finding-wannier-functions">The Problem of Finding Wannier Functions</h4>
<p>Now that we have defined the collection \(\{ \psi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \}\) we can define the problem of finding well localized Wannier functions. We begin with two definitions</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Fix some \(N \in \N\), define the projector \(P\) as the span onto the first \(N\) bands of the Hamiltonian \(H\) defined as follows</p>
<p>\[\begin{aligned}
&amp; P(\bm{k}) := \sum_{n=1}^N \vert \psi_{n,\bm{k}} \rangle \langle \psi_{n,\bm{k}} \vert \\[2ex]
&amp; P := \int^{\oplus}_{\Omega^*} P(\bm{k}) \text{d}\bm{k}
\end{aligned}\]</p>
<p>Where \(\int^{\oplus}_{\Omega^*} \text{d}\bm{k}\) denotes the &ldquo;direct integral&rdquo; (continuous version of direct sum) over the Brillouin zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: We say a collection of functions \(\{ w_{n, \bm{R}} \}\) are an \(s\) localized generalized Wannier basis for \(s &gt; 0\) for \(P\) if</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\{ w_{n, \bm{R}} \}\) forms an orthogonal basis for \(\text{range}{(P)}\)</li>
<li>There exists a constant \(C\) so that for all \(n, \bm{R}\)</li>
</ol>
<p>\[\int_{\R^2} (1 + |\bm{x} - \bm{R}|)^{s} |w_{n, \bm{R}}(\bm{x})|^2 \text{d}\bm{x} \leq C\]</p>
<p>If we can replace \((1 + |\bm{x} - \bm{R}|)^{s}\) with \(e^{2 \gamma \vert \bm{x} - \bm{R} \vert}\) for some \(\gamma &gt; 0\) in the above integral then we say that the basis \(\{ w_{n, \bm{R}} \}\) is an exponentially localized generalized Wannier basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong>: Find a generalized Wannier basis which is as localized as possible (\(s\) localized for \(s \gg 0\) or exponentially localized).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This problem is most well understood when the Hamiltonian \(H\) has a gap between the \(N\) and \(N+1\) band<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Formally, if \(E_{n,\bm{k}}\) is the energy eigenvalue of \(\psi_{n,\bm{k}}\):
\[
H \psi_{n,\bm{k}} = E_{n,\bm{k}} \psi_{n,\bm{k}}
\]
we say that \(H\) has a gap of size \(g\) between the \(N\) and \(N+1\) band if
\[
\inf_{k \in \Omega^*} |E_{N+1,\bm{k}} - E_{N,\bm{k}}| \geq g &gt; 0.
\]
For simplicity, in these notes, we will make the slightly stronger assumption<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
\[
\inf_{k \in \Omega^*} |E_{N+1,\bm{k}}| - \sup_{k \in \Omega^*} |E_{N,\bm{k}}| \geq g &gt; 0.
\]
Physically speaking, this stronger assumption means we are only considering insulators and not semimetals.</p>
<p>Below, we plot some 2d energy bands without a gap (left) and with a gap (right):</p>
<figure><img src="../../wannier-functions/haldane_bands.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Assuming that \(H\) has a gap, one can show that in real space we have
\[
\vert P(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) \vert \lesssim e^{-c_{gap} \vert \bm{x} - \bm{y}\vert}
\]
where \(c_{gap} = O(g)\). Therefore as the gap between the \(N\) and \(N+1\) bands gets smaller and smaller, the projector \(P\) becomes less and less localized. As a matrix, the above estimate implies that the off diagonal entries of \(P\) decay exponentially quickly (see below):</p>
<figure><img src="../../wannier-functions/plot_of_p.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Because of this estimate on \(P\), we might hope that \(P\) has an exponentially localized basis of generalized Wannier functions which decay at the same rate as \(P\). That is, if \(w_{n,\bm{R}}\) is a basis function with center \(\bm{R}\) we have
\[
\vert w_{n,\bm{R}}(\bm{x}) \vert \sim e^{-c_{gap} \vert \bm{x} - \bm{R} \vert}
\]
It turns out that for generic gapped systems in one dimension, it is always possible to construct such a basis. In two dimensions and higher however, constructing such bases are generically <em>topologically obstructed</em>.</p>
<h3 id="wannier-functions-and-parallel-transport-gauge">Wannier Functions and Parallel Transport Gauge</h3>
<h4 id="construction-of-wannier-functions">Construction of Wannier Functions</h4>
<p>Mathematically speaking, it is somewhat awkward to work with the Bloch functions directly in part because they live in different copies of \(L^2_{\bm{k}}(\Omega)\) for different values of \(\bm{k}\). To alleviate this, we define the <strong>periodic Bloch functions</strong>, \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\), as follows:
\[
u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) := e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot \bm{x}} \phi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x})
\]
It is easily checked that \(u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x})\) is periodic with respect to the lattice \(\Lambda\).
\[\begin{aligned}
u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x} + \bm{v})
&amp; = e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot (\bm{x} + \bm{v})} \phi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x} + \bm{v}) \\[1ex]
&amp; = e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot \bm{x}} \phi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \\[1ex]
&amp; = u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{k})
\end{aligned}\]
where in the second to last line, we have used the fact that \(\phi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \in L^2_{\bm{k}}(\Omega)\). For each \(\bm{R} \in \Lambda\), the Wannier functions centered at \(\bm{R}\) is then defined through the Fourier transform of the periodic Bloch functions:
\[\begin{aligned}
w_{n,\bm{R}}(\bm{x})
&amp; = \frac{1}{|\Omega^*|} \int_{\Omega^*} e^{i \bm{k} \cdot \bm{R}} \psi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \text{d} \bm{k} \\[2ex]
&amp; = \frac{1}{|\Omega^*|} \int_{\Omega^*} e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot (\bm{x} - \bm{R})} u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \text{d} \bm{k}.
\end{aligned}\]
With this definition, it is easy to show that decay of the Wannier functions depends on the smoothness of \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\) as a function of \(\bm{k}\). In particular, muliplying both sides of the above equation by \(x_1 - R_1\) we have that
\[\begin{aligned}
(x_1 - R_1) w_{n,\bm{R}}(\bm{x})
&amp; = \frac{1}{|\Omega^*|} \int_{\Omega^*} (x_1 - R_1) e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot (\bm{x} - \bm{R})} u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \text{d} \bm{k} \\[1ex]
&amp; = \frac{1}{|\Omega^*|} \int_{\Omega^*} i \frac{\partial}{\partial k_1}( e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot (\bm{x} - \bm{R})}) u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \text{d} \bm{k} \\[1ex]
&amp; = -\frac{1}{|\Omega^*|} \int_{\Omega^*} i e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot (\bm{x} - \bm{R})} (\partial_{k_1} u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x})) \text{d} \bm{k}
\end{aligned}\]
where the boundary terms from integration by parts vanish since \(R \in \Lambda\) and \(u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x})\) is periodic. It follows that
\[
\| (x_1 - R_1) w_{n,\bm{R}} \|_{L^2_x} \leq \sup_{\bm{k}} \| \partial_{k_1} u_{n,\bm{k}} \|_{L^2_x}.
\]
In particular, if \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\) is continuously differentiable in \(k_1\) then \(w_{n,\bm{R}}\) decays at least as fast as \(\vert x_2 - R_1 \vert^{-1}\) in the x-direction. If we repeat this argument for \((x_2 - R_2) w_{n,\bm{R}}\), we conclude that \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\) is continuously differentiable in \(k_2\) then \(w_{n,\bm{R}}\) decays at least as fast as \(\vert x_2 - R_2 \vert^{-1}\) in the y-direction.</p>
<p>Repeating integration by parts \(\ell\) times, we can easily see that \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\) being \(\ell\) times continuously differentiable implies that the corresponding Wannier function decays like \(\vert{} \bm{x} - \bm{R} \vert{}^{-\ell}\). Futhermore, if \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\) is analytic as a function of \(\bm{k}\) in a strip, then (a generalization of) the Paley-Wiener theorem implies that the corresponding Wannier functions \(\{ w_{n,\bm{R}} \}\) decay exponentially quickly.</p>
<h4 id="the-gauge-freedom">The Gauge Freedom</h4>
<p>As we saw in the previous section, if we can show that the periodic Bloch functions \(\{ u_{n,\bm{k}} \}\) are smooth as a function of \(\bm{k}\) then we can show that the corresponding Wannier functions decay quickly in space. In fact, since the Fourier transform is invertible, this is an if and only if statement: The Wannier functions \(\{ w_{n,\bm{R}} \}\) defined as above decay quickly in space if and only if the functions \(\{ u_{n,\bm{k}} \}\) are smooth and periodic in \(\bm{k}\).</p>
<p>If there were a unique choice of the functions \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\) then this would essentially be the end of the story, but (thankfully) there is some freedom in how we define the periodic Bloch functions. Recall that we defined the Bloch functions \(\{ \psi_{n,\bm{k}} \}\) as joint eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian \(H\) and translation. However, eigenfunctions are only defined up to a choice of complex phase. Therefore, we could have just as well defined \(\psi_{n,\bm{k}}\) and \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\) as follows:
\[\begin{aligned}
&amp; \psi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \mapsto e^{i \theta_{n}(\bm{k})} \psi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \\[1ex]
&amp; u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \mapsto e^{i \theta_{n}(\bm{k})} u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x})
\end{aligned}\]
where \(\theta_n(\bm{k})\) is any real valued function. Therefore, by carefully choosing the function \(\theta_n(\bm{k})\), we can hopefully improve the regularity of the periodic Bloch functions so that the resulting Wannier functions decay quickly in space.</p>
<p>In practice, people have found that the regularity of \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\) can be improved even further if we allow the different bands to mix. That is we perform the transformation
\[
u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \mapsto \sum_{m} u_{m,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) U_{m,n}(\bm{k})
\]
where for each \(\bm{k} \in \Omega^*\), \(U(\bm{k}) \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times N}\) is a unitary matrix. This \(\bm{k}\) dependent family of unitary matrices is known as the <strong>gauge freedom</strong>.</p>
<p>Under a fixed choice of gauge, the Wannier functions are now written as
\[
w_{n,\bm{R}}(\bm{x}) = \frac{1}{|\Omega^*|} \int_{\Omega^*} e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot (\bm{x} - \bm{R})} \left( \sum_{m} u_{m,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) U_{m,n}(\bm{k}) \right) \text{d} \bm{k}.
\]
Typically, when we allow the different bands of the system to mix, the corresponding Wannier functions are known as the <strong>composite</strong> Wannier functions.</p>
<p>Based on the previous discussion on Wannier functions, it is clear that the problem of finding well localized Wannier functions is equivalent to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Equivalent Problem Statment</strong>: Find a family of unitary matrices \(U(\bm{k}) \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times N}\) so that for each \(n\), the function
\[\tilde{u}_{n, \bm{k}}(\bm{x}) = \sum_{m} u_{m,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) U_{m,n}(\bm{k})\]
is smooth and periodic in \(\bm{k}\).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="parallel-transport-gauge--in-progress">Parallel Transport Gauge (IN PROGRESS)</h4>
<p>In the last section, we showed that the problem of finding a well localized Wannier function in periodic systems is equivalent to studying a family of unitary matrices \(U(\bm{k})\). Over the past couple of decades there have been a number of results which have carefully studied these unitary matrices through the tools of bundle theory and differential geometry<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. While initially, most of the results on Wannier functions were limited to abstract existence results, more recently there have been a few works (if you&rsquo;re interested I can give you some references).</p>
<p>In this section, we will give a construction of a &ldquo;nice&rdquo; gauge by parallel transport. This construction doesn&rsquo;t always give an analytic and periodic gauge in both \(k_1\) and \(k_2\), but it is the more formal version of what Mike Z. uses in his notes. For this gauge construciton, we will need to define a &ldquo;new&rdquo; orthogonal projector \(P_{*}(\bm{k})\)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: We define the periodic projector \(P_{*}(\bm{k})\) as the projection onto the span of \(\{ u_{n,\bm{k}} \}\)
\[ P_{*}(\bm{k}) := \sum_{n=1}^N \vert u_{n,\bm{k}} \rangle \langle u_{n,\bm{k}} \vert\]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Observe that when we write \(P_{*}(\bm{k})\) in terms of its integral kernel, we have that
\[\begin{aligned}
P_{*}(\bm{k})(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) &amp; = \sum_{n=1}^N u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \overline{u_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{y})} \\[1ex]
&amp; = \sum_{n=1}^N e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot (\bm{x} - \bm{y})}  \phi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{x}) \overline{\phi_{n,\bm{k}}(\bm{y})}
\end{aligned}\]
So this projector differs slightly from the previous projector \(P(\bm{k})\). We would like to stress the quite surprising fact</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Fact</strong>: Even though \(P_{*}(\bm{k})\) is analytic in \(\bm{k}\), this does <strong>does not</strong> imply that that \(u_{n,\bm{k}}\) is analytic and periodic in \(\bm{k}\) even when \(N = 1\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will now use the projector \(P_{*}(\bm{k})\) to construct a gauge which is analytic \(\bm{k}\) and periodic in \(k_1\), but not necessarily periodic in \(k_2\).</p>
